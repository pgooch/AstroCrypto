<Layout title="AstroCrypto">
  <p>
    Let's say you want to build a nice little static site but want some content
    on it to be protect so only <em>some</em> people can see it. This is a simple
    thing to do when the content is generated by the server, you can run authentication
    on the server and add data is required but if you want a fully static site with
    the simplest hosting possible you need to get a little more creative.
  </p>
  <EncryptedContent>
    <p class="box">
      Of course, if the password is too simple all the encryption in the world
      won't help. In reality you'd want to set it to something a little more
      complex. By default this content is encrypted with whatever the <code
        >PASSWORD</code
      > enviromental variable is.
    </p>
  </EncryptedContent>
  <p>
    There are some caveats to this of course. First all the content and
    information needed to decrypt the contect <em>except for the password</em> is
    stored on the page. The code that decrypts it also lays out all the specifics
    of how it was encrypted leaving nothign to guess for a would-be ner-do-weller
    to crack it at their liesure. Nothing that needs to be truly secure should use
    this system.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what is it for then? Really nothing, however the thought I had in mind
    when building this (besides just looking for something to use the WebCrypto
    API with) was to build a portal page for a home server. There are several
    things I'd like to run that have web-facing interfaces that can be accessed
    from outside my home network. I wanted to be able to create a page that
    would list those services for me but that was little more secure than a
    simple webpage, no need to give anybody targets to start prodding.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also a <a href="crypto-test">crypto-test</a> page for testing the crypto.js
    file in the client. It was build to test my understanding of the underlying WebCrypto
    API before implementing it into the Astro middleware.
